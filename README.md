## 😅 Summary of My Experience

Building ACONEWS was a fantastic learning experience. From fetching live data from the GNews API to designing a responsive frontend, it was a journey filled with challenges and victories. 

### Victories:
- **API Integration**: I successfully integrated the GNews API into the app, and seeing the live news feed for the first time was incredibly satisfying.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the UI looked sleek and responsive across various devices was a major achievement.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Deploying the app to Firebase was quick and efficient, making the app accessible globally.

### Challenges:
- **API Key Management**: Handling environment variables across local and deployed environments took some trial and error.
- **CSS Tweaks**: Ensuring pixel-perfect responsiveness had me pulling out my hair a few times!
  
### The Time I Cried:
There was that one moment when the app didn’t compile due to a typo in my `.env` file that took far too long to figure out. After fixing it, I was back on track, feeling both relieved and empowered.

## ❤️ Special Thanks

Big thanks to Acowale for providing to showcase my work, the GNews team for their awesome API and the Firebase team for providing such a smooth deployment experience.

## Note

The Gnews API allows 100 request per day. So if you are unable to see news it's because you have reached the daily request limit.
